# Apex Parkour

A collection of Apex Legends parkour maps for R5Reloaded.




## Installation

1. Download the `mp_rr_desertlands_common.nut`
2. Place the file in `<R5BaseFolder>\platform\scripts\vscripts\mp\levels`
3. Host a server and select 'mp_rr_desertlands_64k_x_64k'
4. For teleport commands, open the console with `~` or `insert` and run `bind j cpTeleport; bind k cpAdd; bind l cpSub; cpTeleport`
* Use J to go to the current checkpoint
* Use K to go to the next checkpoint
* Use L to go to the previous checkpoint

Currently you have to navigate between checkpoints manually, we'll add automatic checkpoint tracking sometime soon hopefully.
