# Apex Parkour

A collection of Apex Legends parkour maps for R5Reloaded.




## Installation

1. Download the <a href="https://github.com/JayTheYggdrasil/ApexParkour/releases/download/v1.1/mp_rr_desertlands_common.nut">mp_rr_desertlands_common.nut </a>
2. Place the file in `<R5BaseFolder>\platform\scripts\vscripts\mp\levels`
* Make sure to replace the existing file
4. Host a server and select 'mp_rr_desertlands_64k_x_64k' or 'worlds edge'
5. For teleport commands, open the console with `~` or `insert` and run `bind j cpTeleport; bind k cpAdd; bind l cpSub; cpTeleport`
* Use J to go to the current checkpoint
* Use K to go to the next checkpoint
* Use L to go to the previous checkpoint
6. Use Noclip when practicing, it's super pog. You can bind noclip by typing 'bind key noclip'. I recommend binding something really easy to press, I use lctrl. 

Currently you have to navigate between checkpoints manually, we'll add automatic checkpoint tracking sometime soon hopefully.
